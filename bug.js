This error occurs when using AsyncStorage in React Native. The AsyncStorage.getItem() method sometimes returns null even though the item exists in storage. This is inconsistent and makes it difficult to handle data retrieval reliably. This is especially problematic when dealing with critical data that requires a reliable retrieval mechanism. The error is not always reproducible; therefore debugging becomes difficult.
