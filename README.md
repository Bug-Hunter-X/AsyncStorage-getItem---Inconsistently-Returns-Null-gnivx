# AsyncStorage.getItem() Inconsistently Returns Null in React Native

This repository demonstrates a bug where `AsyncStorage.getItem()` in React Native inconsistently returns `null`, even when the key exists in AsyncStorage. This behavior is unpredictable and can lead to data loss or application crashes if not handled properly. The provided solution offers a more robust approach to retrieve data from AsyncStorage.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the app on an iOS or Android simulator/device.
3. Observe that `AsyncStorage.getItem()` sometimes returns `null` even though the key exists, making data retrieval unreliable. 

## Solution

The solution involves implementing retry mechanisms and error handling to make data retrieval more reliable. Check the `bugSolution.js` file for implementation details.

## Technologies Used

- React Native
- AsyncStorage
